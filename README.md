# Project Description

This project consists of implementing a text-based standard math calculator.  <br /> 
This is a console application that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.

# Functionality

This console-based calculator allows the user to perform:
-	Addition operation
-	Subtraction operation
-	Multiplication operation
-	Division operation
-	Modulo operation
-	Find the square of a number
-	Find the square root of a number
-	Find the inverse of a number
-	Negate a number
-	Display the history of all the operations perfromed
-	Exit program

Additionally, the user can also perform the following operations on a single operand:
-	Find the square of the operand
-	Find the square root of the operand
-	Find the inverse of the operand
-	Negate the operand
-	Clear operand (i.e. CE button)
-	Clear expression (i.e. C button)

Moreover, the user can also perform the following, using the result of the very last operation performed:
•	Addition operation using the result of the last operation
•	Subtraction operation using the result of the last operation
•	Multiplication operation using the result of the last operation
•	Division operation using the result of the last operation
•	Modulo operation using the result of the last operation
•	Find the square of the result of the last operation
•	Find the square root of the result of the last operation
•	Find the inverse of the result of the last operation
•	Negate the result of the last operation

# Running and Testing the Project
